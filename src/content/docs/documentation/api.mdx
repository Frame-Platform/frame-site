import SwaggerUI from '../../../components/SwaggerUI.astro'

Welcome to the Frame API reference. This page provides an interface for exploring the API using the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) specification format.

You can use this UI to:
- View all available REST endpoints
- Inspect required parameters and response types

---

 These are the exact endpoints that will be available once Frame is deployed to your own AWS account. The OpenAPI spec is fully aligned with the infrastructure-as-code setup, so what you see here is what your deployed system will expose.
