Frame transforms the complex challenge of image search into an accessible developer tool by addressing each component of a complete multimodal embedding pipeline \- validation, pre-processing, embedding, storage, and querying. Frameâ€™s architecture balances performance, reliability, and simplicity: embracing serverless computing, implementing asynchronous processing, and solving common challenges like local image file uploads.

For teams who need image search capabilities but lack the resources or expertise for custom solutions, Frame offers a practical solution, delivering core functionality without unnecessary complexity.

Please refer to Frame's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/UntitledCapstoneProj), comprehensive [documentation](/documentation/deployment/), and [demonstration videos](/case-study/introducing-frame#demonstration) for complete implementation details.
